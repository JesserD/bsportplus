                Wellness program - workplace exercise and a healthy
                food (B-SPORT+)</H1>

            <H2>1. Explanation of the activity</H2>

            <H3>1. Wellness between working hours and challenges</H3>
            <P>No matter what work you do or sit or stand, allow yourself to move through the workday.
                Most people have some form of exercise that they could enjoy. Employees should be able to
                take initiatives on what types of wellness activities they want, and the employer can help them
                organize them. For example, if an employee likes to take a walk, make an appointment with him
                on a walk.</P>

            <P>Some physical activities can be included in the category of 'learning' or 'education', which can
                help leaders find resources in their budgets.</P>
            <img src={Wellness1} alt='' />

            <H3>2. Model of relief with the help of physical and sports activities</H3>
            <P>The aim is to raise the level of general and special abilities of employees in order to more easily
                withstand the load and increase the "resistance" to various stresses.</P>
            <img src={Exercise2} alt='' />

            <H3>3. Model of relaxation with the help of physical sports activities</H3>
            <P>It covers short-term impacts designed to counteract the negative effects of overload
                experiences. Relaxation techniques come into consideration (autogenic training, yoga, relaxing
                gymnastic exercises for different parts of the body, breathing exercises, stretching…</P>
            <img src={Exercise3} alt='' />

            <H3>4. Programmed recreational break</H3>
            <P>It is intended to directly eliminate experiences of overwork in the workplace and to alleviate the
                consequences of disruptive factors. It is a form introduced where the worker performs
                repetitive manual work, especially suitable for the disabled.</P>
            <img src={Exercise4} alt='' />

            <H3>5. Incorporating a healthy diet - courses - preparing a healthy meal</H3>
            <P>People in the workplace consume an average of 500-800 kcal per day. Research has shown
                that food in the workplace often has a lot of empty calories. With this, however, we determine
                how little food consumed gives employees the necessary substances.
                Each of us consumes a different amount of calories per day, as consumption depends on how
                active we are in a given day. In any case, the amount of food in an individual meal is also very
                important, and the ratio of macronutrients must be adapted to the individual's needs. In the
                case of a predominantly sedentary individual, the portion is definitely much smaller or there are
                fewer meals during the day than in the case of an active individual.
                When thinking about ingredients for preparing a healthy meal, you will never miss out if fresh
                seasonal vegetables appear on the list. When choosing quality macronutrients, it makes sense
                to consider local and seasonal products. For carbohydrates, choose those with a higher content
                of protein and fiber and a lower glycemic index. Above all, it is good to avoid simple sugars and
                processed foods as much as possible. In the case of protein, it makes sense to choose as
                diverse a diet as possible, both of plant and animal origin. Each source separately also contains
                various vitamins and minerals that contribute to our health and well-being.
                When leaders organize group meetings or individual meetings, set a goal to offer employees
                healthy opportunities. These can be veggie trays, fruits and nuts. It is also recommended to limit
                the availability of food and vending machines and rather organize a bar where you can prepare
                a salad yourself.Healthy eating includes several aspects. The number of meals is very
                important. The amount of food should be appropriate for physical activity. Food includes all the
                substances that the body needs to function and grow.</P>
            <img src={Nutrition5} alt='' />

            <H3>6. Fluid supply</H3>
            <P>The body has many, very complex systems for regulating water and, of course, operates
                according to its own priority supply. Water is a means of transport in the body, it is important
                for water-dependent chemical reactions in the body (hydrolysis), it works in elementary
                intercellular exchange, especially in the transmission of nerve impulses and last but not least
                water forms a special structure, pattern and shape in cell architecture.</P>
            <P>Drinking during an activity has two functions. The first is to replace the
                body fluid we have lost through sweating and breathing, the second is to
                provide fuel for the body.
                It should be borne in mind that a higher amount of sugar in the drink
                increases its caloric content, but slows down gastric emptying. This results
                in a reduced water supply to the body.
                Recommended drinks for honey and before exertion are isotonic or
                hypotonic, which are characterized by rapid resorption from the
                gastrointestinal tract and thus allow rapid rehydration.
                After the activity, hypertonic drinks with a higher content of mineral salts
                and sugars are recommended. With them, we achieve primarily energy
                regeneration.</P>

            <H2>2. Results</H2>
            <P>Individual groups of employees involved will be monitored through questionnaires about their
                satisfaction, well-being, and perhaps also progress (better exercise, weight loss, change in
                eating habits.</P>
            <img src={Results7} alt='' />

            <H2>3. Key success factors (Communication, participation, motivation… )</H2>
            <img src={KeySuccessFactors8} alt='' />

            <H2>4. Key challenges and Opportunities</H2>
            <small>How was funding done and can it be done in a sustainable way?. (some sentence).</small>
            <small>During the pilot of these activity what went well and what need to be improved?. (some sentence).</small>
            <P>Already through previous pilot activities, it has been shown that it is easier for employees to get
                involved in activities if they have the opportunity to co-create them themselves.
                First of all, it will be necessary to find people in the group who already have experience in
                individual areas. We ask them if they are ready to lead "workshops". We are only looking for
                external contractors, teachers, coach teams.</P>

            <P>A set of activities and resources is prepared in advance, and the approximate cost to be covered
                by the company at the beginning is determined. If individuals are satisfied, the costs are gradually
                transferred to the individual or group by upgrading knowledge (easier distribution). The rule
                should be, "eat what you cooked."
                The concept of independent food preparation in the workplace should be maintained among
                employees.</P>
            <img src={Challenges9} alt='' />
            <P>Physical activity, depending on the experience of loads and needs, can be (guided) performed
                either individually or in groups.
                The employer partially or fully finances entry fees at recreational events (running, cycling). He
                also arranges jerseys (T-shirts, pants, hats) in the "colors" of the company promoted by the
                employees. In this way, we further strengthen our belonging to the group, the company.</P>
